*Codex Mutabilis* is a journal for publishing short notes on mandatory changes to species names according to the [International Code of Zoological Nomenclature](https://www.iczn.org/).

## ICZN Formality

The ICZN has not recognized this as a formal place of publication. A formal application is being submitted to the ICZN. For now, all posts are not to be considered as published acts.

## Submission

Unlike other publishing avenues, this journal is by default currently *not* peer-reviewed. It is, however, indexed.

In order to submit, send a pull request to [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/RichardLitt/codexmutabilis.com/) with a post included. Interested authors can also [send an email](mailto:editors@codexmutabilis.com) with the text of their suggested changes to the main editor. All suggestions on how to improve this process would be welcome.

## Archival

This site is intended to be a permanent record. All archives of this site will be made available through Archive.org. Discussions are underway to archive it at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington.

This site is not affiliated with any company, organization, product, or institution. It is not an advertisement website. It is not a personal blog.

For all intents and purposes, this journal is published in Aotearoa New Zealand.

### DOIs

All posts will need to be assigned DOIs, which will function as permanent identifiers. As well, it would be worth publishing a PDF of each of the posts - although this is not strictly necessary. Another option is to assign version numbers to each post, and to upload them automatically to Zenodo.

Work will be tracked in [the GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RichardLitt/codexmutabilis.com/issues).

## Team

The current editorial team is:

* [Richard Littauer](https://burntfen.com). Editor-in-chief.
* [Jessamyn West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessamyn_West_(librarian)). Librarian.

Other people interested in becoming editors should apply by sending an email to [editors@codexmutabilis.com](mailto:editors@codexmutabilis.com).
