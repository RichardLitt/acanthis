[_Prunum boreale_ (A. E. Verrill, 1884)](https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=160011) was made available as _Marginella borealis_, A. E. Verrill 1884. _Borealis_ is only an adjective in Classical Latin, but it was substantivized as a noun in Medieval Latin, according to the [Mittellateinisches WÃ¶rterbuch](https://mlat.uzh.ch/dictionaries). The ICZN notes in the [Glossary](https://code.iczn.org/formation-and-treatment-of-names/article-30-gender-of-genus-group-names?frame=1) that Latin "includes both ancient and mediaeval Latin". Verrill did not make any statement indicating that _borealis_ was to be considered as an adjective or a noun, nor that it was derived from a non-Latin or non-Greek word. According to ICZN 31.2.2, the species name must be considered as a noun in apposition to the genus, and the original spelling is to be retained.

_Prunum borealis_ (A. E. Verrill, 1884) is the correct name.

This is to be considered a valid act according to the ICZN and is not disclaimed.
